In order to work on assignments and projects, you need to fork and clone this tree:

```bash
yum -y install git
git config --global user.name "User Name"
git config --global user.email "user@email"
```

After forking to user (or group) `user-or-group`:

```bash
git clone https://git.noexec.org/<user-or-group>/linux-design.git
```
